#Design
- Text based game that runs in the computers terminal(Mac OS)/ CommandLine(Windows/Linux)
- Game will also run the same way inside python's idle shell
- The game board prints out the variables with various symbols as strings in a specific way to look as if its a real game
- The beginning of the game will read a text file that prints the insturctions on how to play the game with examples
- The program will then prompt the user on what mode they will like to play, their name, and what symbol they wish to play as
- after the game finishes between users or against the computer, options will be given to play again, quit, or change modes

#How It Works / Methods
This program works with similar duplicate methods, so almost every method will be paired with another on how they function
